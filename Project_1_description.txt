Network Analysis & ML with Graphs  
CIS 4930 / CAI 5155  
 
Project 1:  
Uncovering Clinical Patterns with Network Analysis  
1. Project Overview  
In this project, you will use Social Network Analysis techniques to analyze patterns within 
the EHRShot dataset. Your task is to construct networks from patient health events 
(diagnoses, medications, procedures, labs, demographics, etc) and identify meaningful 
structures such as communities, progressions, and  co-occurrence patterns.  
This project is designed to build intuition about the hidden structure of health data before 
we move into predictive modeling (e.g., Graph Neural Networks) later in the course.  
2. Project Goal  
• Represent EHR data as a network and understand its structural properties.  
• Discover recurring patterns, groups, or sequences in medical data.  
• Learn to interpret these structures as potential medical insights.  
• Practice applying classical SNA tools (without machine learning).  
3. Why Network Analysis on EHR Data?  
• Medical records contain complex interconnections : diagnoses, treatments, labs, 
demographics.  
• Networks provide a natural way to visualize and quantify these interconnections.  
• SNA reveals hidden communities, care pathways, or demographic -specific trends.  
• Structural analysis can uncover biases, data quality issues, and recurring clinical 
patterns.

The diagram above shows the relationship between tables in EHRShot  dataset. For brief 
descriptions of tables, please refer to ‘ Lecture_03_Project dataset ’ slides.

4. Possible Types of Networks You Can Build  
There are thousands of different ways to construct networks using EHR data. Below are 
some examples for your reference.  
• Co-occurrence networks : Nodes = diagnoses/medications; Edges = appear 
together in same visit.  
• Temporal networks : Directed edges from earlier → later events in patient history.  
• Bipartite networks : Patients ↔ diagnoses, or diagnoses ↔ drugs.  
• Demographic -specific networks : Separate graphs for subgroups (e.g., 
male/female, young/elderly).  
• Multilayer networks : Combine different event types as multiple interconnected 
layers.

5. Example Research Questions  
You are encouraged to frame your own research question. Be CREATIVE !  
Examples include:  
• What communities of diagnoses or medications frequently co -occur?  
• How do disease progressions differ by age or gender?  
• Which diagnoses act as bridges between otherwise separate clusters?  
• Are there distinct sub -communities for chronic vs. acute conditions?  
• What are the most central or influential events in the network?  
6. Network Analysis Techniques to Use  
• Degree and weighted degree  
• Centrality: betweenness, closeness, eigenvector  
• Community detection (e.g., Louvain, modularity maximization)  
• Density and clustering coefficient  
• Motif or triad analysis (optional)  
• Subgroup comparison across demographic -specific networks  
7. Project Tasks  
1. Explore Dataset  
2. Brainstorm with your teammates and Define a Research Question  
3. Select Data Subset : Choose a manageable portion of EHRShot data ( a specific 
disease, patients older than 90 years old, etc ). Document your selection and 
preprocessing steps.  
4. Define Nodes and Edges : Decide on a network representation. Examples include:  
a. Co-occurrence networks (diagnoses or medications appearing together).  
b. Temporal networks (directed edges from earlier to later events).  
c. Bipartite networks (patients ↔ diagnoses, or diagnoses ↔ drugs).  
d. Demographic -specific networks (separate graphs by gender, age group, 
etc.).  
5. Build the Network : Construct the graph using a library such as  PyG,  NetworkX , or 
igraph. Ensure edge weights and node labels are meaningful.  
6. Analyze Structure : Apply core social network analysis  techniques such as degree 
distribution, centrality, clustering coefficients, and community detection.

7. Interpret Results : Identify and describe patterns such as co -occurring clusters, 
common progressions, or demographic -specific trends. Relate your findings to real -
world medical understanding.  
8. Visualize and Summarize : Provide clear, readable network visualizations and 
summarize findings in figures or tables.  
8. Deliverables  
• Graph files : Node and edge lists.  
• Code : A Jupyter notebook or Python script with clear documentation.  
• Project Report  
o Section 1. Introduction  
▪ Motivate why your research question matters in the context of 
healthcare and EHR data.  
▪ Find and describe related works.  
▪ Provide background on network analysis in healthcare (e.g., co -
occurrence of diagnoses, progression of diseases, patient -drug 
networks).  
▪ Clearly state your research question(s) or objectives. Examples:  
• “We aim to identify comorbidity clusters among chronic 
diseases.”  
• “We analyze temporal progression of diagnoses in older 
adults.”  
▪ End with a summary of contributions: what your analysis reveals and 
why it is valuable.  
 
o Section 2. Network Construction Details  
▪ Dataset: Describe what subset of EHRShot you used.  
▪ Preprocessing: Explain how you cleaned, filtered, and standardized 
data (e.g., merged rare codes, removed missing values).  
▪ Node definition: What entities are represented (diagnoses, 
medications, procedures, demographics)?  
▪ Edge definition: How are relationships formed (co -occurrence, 
temporal sequence, bipartite links)?  
▪ Edge weights: Whether you used raw counts, frequencies, or binary 
connections.

▪ Provide enough detail for another student to replicate your network 
construction.  
 
o Section 3. Metrics and Analysis Methods  
▪ Explain which network metrics you applied and why.  
▪ Justify why each metric is relevant to your research question.  
▪ If you compare across subgroups (e.g., male vs female), describe how 
you built and compared those networks.  
▪ Reference standard definitions briefly (formulas not required unless 
you use nonstandard variants).  
 
o Section 4. Visualizations and Tables  
▪ Include network diagrams to illustrate your findings (keep them 
readable — avoid excessive clutter).  
▪ Provide tables or plots of key statistics  
▪ Each figure/table should have a clear caption and be referenced in 
the text.  
▪ Focus on clarity and interpretability, not artistic visuals.  
 
o Section 5. Interpretations and Conclusions  
▪ Interpret structural patterns in the context of healthcare.  
▪ Discuss what your findings reveal about patient care or medical 
relationships.  
▪ Acknowledge limitations (e.g., data sparsity, coding bias, lack of 
temporal granularity).  
▪ Suggest future directions (e.g., adding more event types, applying 
GNNs later in the course).  
 
o Writing Guidelines  
▪ Length: 4 –5 pages in double -column (~2,000 words).  
▪ Style: Clear, concise, scientific writing.  
▪ Use citations where appropriate (e.g., to network science or 
healthcare informatics papers).  
▪ Each section should flow logically and connect back to your research 
question.
